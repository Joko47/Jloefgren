	<h2 class="spacedhead highlight"><span>T</span><span class="spacedhead headline">he Website</span></h2>
	<p class="body">
		This is the project log for making this website. You can find a github link to the project files <a class="link-txt" href="https://github.com/alias/SiteName" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The guide will likely not contain any pictures, as you can navgate around the page, to see what i am talking about. I will also try to comment the code as thoroughly as I can. So i won't have to explain everything here
	</p>
	<p class="body">
		My goal is to create a responsive website, working on most devices, for ease of use on any monitor size.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h1 class="spacedhead project-sub"><span class="spacedhead highlight">T</span><span>he basics</span></h1>
	<p class="body">
		Before having made this design, I used a website builder. I had found a design I actually quite liked, so given that as a baseline, I wanted to build my own for maximum control.
	</p>
	<p class="body">
		The header and footer of the webpage is reused on every page. They are therefore very important, and should be designed acordingly. They should provide the user with easy and fast use of the site. This is also done in a couple of templates. This allows me to only change the header and footer in a few templates, rather than on every page i create.
	</p>
	<p class="body">
		I created a simple black bar to use for both the header and the footer. This goes great with the grayscaled background I use. I also decided to use red for accents around the page. Then for the header i decided to put the links on the left side, and then use the left side for social buttons. The footer i split into 3 parts, the left containing a contact email and the right containing website name, and copyright + year. I have yet to decide what should go in the middle. I also decided not to have the header follow the page when you scroll down.

	<h1 class="spacedhead project-sub"><span class="spacedhead highlight">W</span><span>elcome page</span></h1>
	<p class="body">
		The Welcome page is the first page you get to, when you enter the basic website. It is named index.html 
	</p>
	<p class="body">
		This page contains a small welcome message, and a brief introduction to my site. There haven't gone a lot of work into this part of the page yet. The work here lies in creating the message. the page should not be overflowing with stuff. But should just be a landing page, to let the guest browse around the page.		
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	
	<h1 class="spacedhead project-sub"><span class="spacedhead highlight">P</span><span>rojects page</span></h1>
	<p class="body">
		The projects page will showcase my projects I want to share. This file is named projects.html
	</p>
	<p class="body">
		This page allows the user to have a small view of my projects, with a small text describing the project. The pictures are made as slideshows, using javascript. the script can be found in slide.js. I also have a small css file, called projects.css describing some projects related styles. 		
	</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h1 class="spacedhead project-sub"><span class="spacedhead highlight">A</span><span>bout page</span></h1>
	<p class="body">
		The about page, called about.html, contains a small decsription of me, letting any guest know, who made the owns this page. This also contains a small slideshow with pictures of me. This has also been made using javascript, however this is put directly into the html document.
	</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h1 class="spacedhead project-sub"><span class="spacedhead highlight">C</span><span>ontact page</span></h1>
	<p class="body">
		The contacts page, allows any guest to send an email to me, without me having to share my email directly. That way I can hopefully keep a great deal of spam off my personal email.
